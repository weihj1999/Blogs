7 Ways to Improve Public Cloud Security

"在你自己负责的数据中心上运行的应用是否安全？或者说是否可以信任云的安全性?"

最初，用户都会非常注重云中的数据安全性,仅仅几年之前，每个人都非常相信在数据中心
里面的应用确实更加安全, 但是我们尽力了一些变化，由商业软件公司Exacta和Pb7发起
的调研表明，其中一个促使SBMs选择迁移到公有云的一个原因是因为它提供的安全性。

非常类似的，Capital One的CIO， Rob Alexander，对云的安全性基于了很高的期望，他宣
布，Capital One押宝于Amazon Web Service，为他的移动银行应用提供的服务。

在很大程度上，这种变化在于云服务商自身， CSPs投入了很大的精力和重视到云的安全
性上,是因为他们知道如果没有一个方法来保证他们客户的数据的安全性，他们将没有任何
机会去谈商务。

因此，他们对最新的科技持续调研，研究网络攻击威胁，并投入响应的努力在保证他们系统
的安全性上。你甚至听说过，Apple公司，他们有自己的iCloud，正在和美国政府斗法，
为了避免在用户的系统上创建一个后门，因为这种行为无异于自杀。

最终，关于在哪里存放他们的数据的问题越来越少，但是他们采取了什么措施来避免来自于
安全犯罪行为的威胁。这里有一些重要的办法来提供你的公有云的安全性。

1. 在你的ALAs中提高云安全的重要级别

反复研读你的SLA，确认包含了安全承诺，记住如果在合同中不清楚，它就不能被执行
看起来需要确认的几个典型条目包含：

 1. How will my data be protected? What are the encryption policies?
 2. What security standards does the CSP follow? What defenses do they have in 
place against security risks?
 3. What is the Disaster Recovery Plan?
 4. How are activities in my cloud monitored and logged?
 5. How will the provider handle end-of-business operations and deletion of data?

2. Perform Regular Policy Reviews and Security Audits

The Cloud Usage: Risks and Opportunities Report states that 25.5% of respondents 
don’t have any form of policies to ensure data security within the cloud. That 
alone is a cause for concern.

Your organization should take the time to create, regularly review, and update 
your information security policies. Having regular audits will help determine how closely you and your cloud provider are following your cloud security policies and mitigating threats. Check with your CSP on their policies regarding performing audits, as some may require permission.

If possible, you may also procure the services of third-party auditing services. This ensures objectivity when going over your security processes.

3. Follow an Efficient Monitoring and Logging system

It is critical for your operation to have access to all environment logs, including the creation, deletion, and modification of user accounts and passwords, as well as other important transactions. If something should go wrong, you will have a record of who did what and when—a crucial step for determining loopholes in cloud security.

4. Use Encryption

Encryption lets you secure data going in and out of the public cloud. Cloud providers typically provide their own encryption service to their customers, but if your organization isn’t satisfied with that level of security you may also obtain encryption services from a third party. That way only you and your encryption service have access to the encryption key.

5. Enforce Secure Processes on User Side

Experian’s Data Breach Industry Forecast shows that in 2015, 60% of security breaches were caused by people within the company—that is, the employees themselves.

In order to truly ensure data protection, companies must also control who has access to their data. Your CSP’s security practices also need to be accompanied by user-side protocols and strong authentication.

You may want to include other measures aside from usernames and passwords: physical tokens, key cards,  biometrics, and so on.

6. Use the right security tools and services

Once you have a working knowledge of your CSP’s security capabilities, it would be wise to add to it as you see fit. Refer to the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards to determine what to look out for.

You can also use tools to increase your cloud security. BitGlass, for example, allows you transparent protection for your computers and mobile devices by tracking and encrypting business data. Skyhigh Networks, on the other hand, can show you what applications your employees are using.

7. Test for Vulnerabilities

Security in the cloud means that you must continually check for weaknesses. This applies every time you build a system, whether or not it’s cloud-based.

Some CSPs provide tools for vulnerability testing. For example, Amazon Inspector actively searches for risks and vulnerabilities in your AWS cloud and provides a detailed report for you.

Much of the cloud requires a shared responsibility. You and your provider must work together to ensure both your company’s and customer’s data are protected at all times. The video below discusses how we should rethink our security in the cloud.
